The repository contains all the source code, development notebooks, and supplementary materials used to implement the system and generate the results discussed in this thesis.  

What this project does

Classifies brain CT images as Normal or Stroke.

Uses VGG19 to extract image features.

Reduces feature size with PCA.

Trains a GRU model for final classification.

Provides a Gradio app for easy testing with a single image.

Adds optional audio feedback using gTTS.
